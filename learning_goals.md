* System-level strategies to engineering systems from imprecise specifications and unreliable components (e.g., guardrails and other safety mechanisms)
* Thinking in pipelines not models
* Components of intelligent experiences and corresponding challenges (experience, intelligence, orchestration) within a larger system architecture; overview of design options and automation degrees, e.g., forcefulness of the experience
* Qualities of interest (beyond model accuracy)

Learning goals:

* Explain the consequences of the shift from deductive to inductive reasoning for abstraction and composition
* Explain how machine learning fits into the larger picture of building and maintaining production systems
* Explain the modularity implications of having machine-learning components without specifications
