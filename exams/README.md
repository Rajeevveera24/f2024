# Midterm

This semester, the course will have two midterms, but no final exam. 

The midterms will take the place of one lecture each, they are 80 minutes long. No electronics, but 6 pages of notes (handwritten or printed, both sides, letter size) allowed.

Topic-wise, everything covered in class, in the readings, and in recitation is fair game, though the exam will focus most points on topics where you had some chance to practice (e.g., in assignments, recitation or in-class discussions) not on random recall questions. The second midterm only covers content after the first midterm.

## Practice Material

Midterms from previous semesters are available as practice for the first midterm. We expect the midterm to have a similar format, though topic coverage differs slightly between semesters. We have not previously had a second midterm; the closest is the rather old final from [Fall 2019](https://github.com/ckaestne/seai/blob/F2019/other_material/final_exam.pdf).
